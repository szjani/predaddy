 * It can block and buffer messages in blocking mode. Its state can be configured with start and stop methods.
 * The collected messages can be flushed or cleared according to the needs.

 * For instance in a CQRS environment all events can be buffered until the command is processed.

 * <p> If the message implements {@link NonBlockable} interface, it will never be buffered.
